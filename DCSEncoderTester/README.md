# DCS Encoder Tester

This is a small sub-project to assist with testing the DCS Encoder class.
It implements an interactive command-line program that lets you convert
audio files to the DCS stream format and play them back to test the
results.

This tester program doesn't create DCS ROMs.  See the main DCSEncoder
project for that.
